# ML-Employee-Attrition_project
This project is an end-to-end machine learning application that predicts employee attrition risk based on demographic, job, and workplace factors. It combines data preprocessing, model training, and an interactive Streamlit web interface, allowing users to experiment with employee attributes and observe how predictions change in real time.
